# Comparision of SIFT, SURF and Lucas–Kanade methods for Motion Estimation Application
Motion estimation of objects in video sequence was implemented using diffrent methods, viz. SIFT, SURF and Lucas–Kanade methods.
Their performance were compared with respect to accuracy, efficiency and processing time.

It was found from the results that LK method for detecting optical flow was an optimized algorithm for tracking (among the considered).
